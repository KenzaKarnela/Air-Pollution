## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
dk = USairpollution
head(dk)
nrow(dk)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
# density plots
library(GGally)
ggpairs(dk[,-1])
#manu & popul are strongly right skewed, it is an evidence that there are some outliers.
```

```{r}
# density plots
boxplot(dk)
#We can see that Manufacturing and Population have some notable outliers, letâ€™s find those outliers and remove them.
```

```{r}
# Outliers for Manufacturing
boxplot.stats(dk$manu)$out

# Outliers for Population
boxplot.stats(dk$popul)$out

out_Manu<-boxplot.stats(dk$manu)$out
out_Popul<-boxplot.stats(dk$popul)$out

out_ind1 <- which(dk$manu %in% max(c(out_Manu)))
out_ind2 <- which(dk$popul %in% max(c(out_Popul)))
```

```{r}
# Let;s find out which is cities are outliers
dk[out_ind1,]
dk[out_ind2,]
outs <- c(out_ind1,out_ind2)
```

```{r}
#removeoutliers
dk<- dk[-outs,]
boxplot(dk)
ggpairs(dk[,-1])
```

```{r}
#Covariance Matrix Analysis
S_dk <- var(dk[,-1])
round(S_dk,2)
#Population and Manufacturing have higher variance compared to other variables, so the data needs to be scaled
#bcsvariables are on very different scale or have very different variances, a PCA of the data should be performed on the Correlation Matrix.
```

```{r}
#Correlation Matrix Analysis
C_dk <- cor(dk[,-1])
corrplot((C_dk) , method = "number")
#manu and popul highly correlated
```

```{r}
#PC Analysis
#Eigen Values
eig_dk<- eigen(C_dk)
round(eig_dk$values,2)
round(eig_dk$values/sum(eig_dk$values),3)
#First three eigen values are greater than one and together account for almost %85 of the variance of the original variables.

```

```{r}
#Scree plot
#perform PCA
results_dk <- prcomp(dk, scale = TRUE)
#calculate total variance explained by each principal component
var_explained_dk = results_dk$sdev^2 / sum(results_dk$sdev^2)

```

```{r}
# PCA with standardizing
dk.pc = princomp(dk[,-1],cor=TRUE)
summary(dk.pc,loadings=T)
#The first component might be regarded about the life condition, because manufacturing and population has higher coefficient indicating relatively poor environment.
#The second component is discloses information about rainfall status in cities.
#The third component has high values in Temperature and Precipitation days with opposite directions. So, this component gives an idea about the weather condition
```

```{r}
ggbiplot(dk.pc)
#We can notice that population & manufacturing and precipitation days& precipitation have same direction, it is a sign that thay both are correlated to each other.
#tamp has opposite direction with temp and precipitation days, so is is a sign thta they are negatively correlated each other.

ggbiplot(dk.pc,labels = rownames(dk.pc$scores))
#This plot shows that Philadelphia and Detroit may have the most SO2 level due to effect of manufacturing and population.
#It looks Buffalo and Seatle are the cities who have the most precipitation days. Cleveland, Milwaukee and Minnesota are the windy cities and Salt Lake City is the city with the lowest humidity.
